# comb_im
An OpenCV based algorithm for processing OH chemiluminescence images acquired using Lightfield

Basic features: Reading and averaging (.spe) partitions, Flame edge detection (Otsu thresholding), Abel inversion.

* Some areas that could be improved: Detecting flame orientation (vertical vs. horizontal), Calculating the position of the burner axis automatically, Attaching burner image for better vizualization, Adjusting brightness (possibly the contrast too) to visualize the injector.

- Examples of the final result:
